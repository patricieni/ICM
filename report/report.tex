\section{Introduction}
Identify potential, explain problem, literature review, explain briefly what you're predicting in light of lit review. Then conclude by using different benchmarks. Obviously explain your model at some point. 
\section{Data statistics}
There are two main datasets, one with biological information and one with clinical data. 
We give a brief description of the merged dataset before preprocessing:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Key 1:} Patient ID - this is not unique across rows
\item \textbf{Key 2:} Surgery date and clinical surgery date. 
These are sometimes off by one day so we took only surgery dates as being relevant.
\end{itemize}
%
There are a total of \textbf{7825} entries and \textbf{6688} unique patients. Each patient has \textbf{30} relevant attributes. For convenience, the attribute names have been renamed more intuitively, and in English :). \\
\\
Some of the attributes have missing values.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Diagnostic dates are there only for one fifth of the patients,  \textbf{1162}.
\item Date of birth (DoB) is missing for \textbf{1002} patients.
\item Date of death is missing for \textbf{4908} entries, should we assume these are survivors? 
\item Gene data is very sparse, i.e. \textbf{Ch} markers.
\item Gender data has \textbf{332} entries missing.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Dealing with Missing data}
Examples.\cite{little2014statistical} \\
Clearly some patients underwent some tests, while others did not. This is a problem we can deal with in a very robust manner as long as we can assume that the data is missing at random (i.e. the mechanism by which it is missing can be described as random, and does not contain relevant information in itself. For example whether a test was conducted or not for a patient does not say something highly relevant about that patient?s condition/survival expectation in itself.) Even if the data is not missing at random, similar techniques would be applied by default of statistics having invented better ones to date, but it would help to understand better the missing data reasons/mechanisms for our variables, to make sure we describe it properly.

\section{Encoding clarifications and target variables}
As previously discussed, in the first phase we are interested in a smaller subset of attributes. The table above indicates some of the variables of interest. Please let us know if we got the right ones and whether we should add more from the dataset. For some of them, some things remain unclear.\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item We aim to add age at surgery as one variable, taking into account surgery date and date of birth. 
\item We do not have any attribute for KPS (performance status score) as far as we know. 
\item The outcome is encoded in the surgery type variable (\textbf{ref:image1}). It is either a type of surgical removal or biopsy. For this variable, does missing data tell us that there was no surgery or that we do not know the outcome?
We can see "aucune" as a type so I would assume that we do not know the outcome. 
\item For radiotherapy and chemotherapy, should we assume that if the patient does not have a date, he did not undergo that treatment? 
\item For IDH mutations (\textbf{ref:image2}), IDH1 and IDH2 seem to predominate there. Are these the two main ones we are interested in? You mentioned IDH wild type which, I assume is the case for non-mutated IDH gene, so I would just say this is the \textbf{Normal} value of IDH1/IDH2 Gene. Is this correct? Furthermore, what does the value "NC" stand for?
\end{enumerate}
%
\textbf{Multiple entries:} On average, patients have more than 1 entry according to how many surgeries they went through. Is that correct and do you have any pointers as to how to treat patients with multiple surgeries? Should we aggregate them or treat them independently? Or perhaps find some other clever way of dealing with that. \\
\\ 
\textbf{Target Variable:}
We want to confirm our idea of selecting the target variable for our models. 
First of all, can we assume that all patients where there is no death date specified, are still alive ?(as opposed to them not being alive anymore, but this record being missing)
Qualitatively we thought of incorporating the surgery date, cancer detection date and death date. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The easiest target to model is a binary variable representing alive/dead.
\item The time between diagnostic date and death date. We would scale this variable accordingly to account for no death. 
\item The time between the first/last surgery and death time. We could incorporate in this the number of surgeries a person had. 
\end{itemize}
%
\textbf{Equivalence between variables:}
In terms of genetic tests, is there any equivalence between the following coding schemes for various genes, i.e. Can we treat \textbf{Normal} as carrying the same meaning across these schemes? See images:\\
