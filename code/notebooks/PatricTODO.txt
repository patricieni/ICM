1. Finish DT/RF workflow with regression and classification including XGBoost. 

Won't do much than what already is ... 
    * What can I do in terms of data viz/data exploration? 
    * tSNE plots for our dataset
    * Data exploration to begin with not just on predictions

    Backlog -  AUC-ROC for multi class  problems 

2. MOFA
    * Figure out what the MOFA means by running yourself the whole thing or just looking at the results in the drive. 
    * How many factors do we have active in what data modalities? 

    Specifically: 

    Cumulatively, the factors explained 41% of variation in the drug response data, 38% in the mRNA data, 24% in the DNA methylation data and and 24% in the     mutation data. 

3. What to do with the life_expectancy variable? Does it make sense to bin it? 

From Poisson when it's all data it goes to Gaussian when it's only up to 1000 days. 
So the question is, do I have to to take some log-normal of the data for it to make sense?
What is the idea in using this variable? and what is the right way? Read somewhere on how to deal with age, and should I even cluster it? ..Maybe I should do Paul's regression on it. 

TODO - fix the script now...
