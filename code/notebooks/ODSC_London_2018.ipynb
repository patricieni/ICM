    "1. **Increase of bias/Underfitting**: \n",
    "    In statistics, bias reflects the extent to which your expected values differ from the true population parameters that you are trying to estimate. Concretely, bias arises in a dataset with missing data whenever for a variable, the missing data differs substantially from the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Longitudinal study** and **dropout** : Let’s take a controlled drug study in medicine. In such a study, one compares the two arms of a study: the treatment arm and the control arm. Bias will depend on the relationship between missingness, treatment, and outcome. It is not uncommon for patients in the treatment arm to drop out due to adverse reactions to the treatment, or due to lack of improvement. In parallel, particularly healthy subjects, or ones who react exceptionally well to the treatment, will have very high completion rates for the study. The former, missing patients, will then become missing data in the final study. Ignoring them would lead to biased estimates of the efficacy of the treatment. We would be estimating how efficient the treatment was for a subsample of the population, the “healthier/better reacting” patients that completed the study, as opposed to the entire target population. \n",
